Open source Speech to text bot for A township tale, Using PyQt for the GUI
Designed to be able to put on your wrist in steamvr, for pausing and unpausing the speech recognition

Clone the whole repo/download as a zip, unzip and then run main.py
For some reason, it doesn't exit cleanly on my system, so I need to close the whole command prompt window

I use Vosk's gigaspeech model, which you can download here: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-en-us-0.42-gigaspeech.zip
